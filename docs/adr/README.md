# Architecture Decision Records

| # | Decision | Status |
|---|---|---|
| [0001](0001-riddler-one-package.md) | Riddler is one package that consumes the statifier family, and the element document is its contract | proposed |
| [0003](0003-template-subset.md) | The template subset | proposed |

New ADRs: next number, same three-section format (Context, Decision,
Consequences), plus the typespecs and worked-example sections this family's
records carry. Pick the number against a freshly fetched remote.

This repository inherits the family's ADR practice rather than restating it,
so there is no local "record architecture decisions" record. A bare
`ADR-NNNN` cites this repository's own records; a cross-repo citation carries
the owning repo's beads prefix - `rd-ADR-0001` is how another repo cites this
repository's ADR-0001, `sd-ADR-0001` is statifier_datamodel's ADR-0001, and
`sb-ADR-0006` is statifier_blocks' ADR-0006. Records in sibling repos that are
still being drafted are cited by bead id until their number is assigned.

A `## Note` on a record carries no Status line. Every Status line in these
records sits on the record's own header or under a `## Amendment`, because an
amendment changes what the record decides and a note does not: a note records
where something already decided renders, or what a sentence already accepted
was about.

A note's heading names the decision it is about and never a bead id; the
first paragraph may name the bead and the ruling the note was recorded for.
The rule that keeps process artifacts out of shipped prose (`CLAUDE.md`)
exempts dated correction and note blocks, and this convention extends that
exemption to these records: the id belongs in the body, where it says why a
paragraph exists, not in the heading, which is what a reader scans and what
another record cites.
